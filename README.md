<!-- ## 🧠 Street Coder Principles I Live By

```python
class StreetCoder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mindset = {
            "pragmatism": "Rules exist to be understood, then bent when needed",
            "shipping": "Done > Perfect. Iterate and improve",
            "debugging": "50% of work is fixing. Embrace it",
            "testing": "Not a chore — it's how you sleep at night",
            "optimization": "80/20 rule. Focus where it matters",
            "security": "Paranoia is a feature, not a bug"
        }
    
    def approach(self, problem):
        return "Solve it. Ship it. Learn from it."
``` -->
